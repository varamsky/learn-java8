This project explains the features added in Java 8.

Java 8 was released on 18th March 2014.

Some of the important Java 8 features are:

1. default and static methods in Interfaces

   - [Coding with John - Lambda Expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj5sLSFjVj4)
3. Method References
4. forEach() method in Iterable interface
5. Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections 
6. Optional class
7. Java Time API 
8. Collection API improvements 
9. Concurrency API improvements 
10. Java IO improvements


This also mentions a few features which were introduced before java 8 in the BeforeJava8 package
1. Generics - Java5
   - [Coding with John - Generics](https://youtu.be/K1iu1kXkVoA)
2. Mutable and Immutable types
3. varargs - Introduced in Java 5
   - Safe usage of varargs
   - varargs vs array
4. super() - Right now this is confusing for me
	- and not using this.instance variable everytime you use an instance variable? how?
